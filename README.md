### Researching the relationship between stock market performance and involuntary CEO dismissal. 

This repository will delve into the intricate dynamics between Negative Financial Performance
Metrics (FPMs) and Involuntary CEO Dismissalâ€”a pivotal facet in contemporary corporate
governance. Leveraging the CEO departure data set from Gentry et al. (2021), this research
identifies and addresses crucial limitations, including the absence of FPMs data, non-standard
company tickers, and challenges with the presentation of time-series data.
At its core, this study centers on meticulous data refinement, yielding a comprehensive data set
encompassing all relevant variables. Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), we strategically
outline variables for analysis and subsequent data set inclusion, avoiding direct causality
assumptions. A pivotal proxy variable emerges within this data set, measuring changes in key
financial performance metrics before and after CEO dismissal. The proxy variable net income is
a binary variable that represents whether or not a given financial metric was above or below the
mean in the given quarter. Serving as both a proxy and a vital treatment variable, this binary
measure gauges whether a company's FPMs experienced a negative or positive shift preceding
the CEO's departure, offering insights into causality.
The analysis aims to illuminate the impact of negative net income on involuntary CEO
dismissal decisions. Employing computational statistics and causal inference methodology, I
rigorously explore the existence of a significant relationship between these variables. Eschewing
overly ambitious claims, the research focuses on data-driven exploration, enhancing our
comprehension of the intricate interplay between microeconomic shocks, the market, and
leadership decisions.
