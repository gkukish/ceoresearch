### Researching the relationship between stock market performance and involuntary CEO dismissal. 
#### Executive Summary
This repository will explore the relationship between a company's financial performance and Involuntary CEO Dismissal. The first stage of the project is to build a custom dataset which will track the financial performance of the S&P 500 companies including adjusted close and trading volume this information will be acquired from finance -- Python library for accessing and downloading financial data from Yahoo Finance. After downloading the financial data for all 500 companies in the S&P 500 index we will create a longitudinal panel dataset that will track each company's financial performance, its industry, sub-industry, and the CEO dismissal. The last stage of the project will focus on predicting the CEO dismissal based on available financial information. 
Leveraging the CEO departure data set from Gentry et al. (2021), this research identifies and addresses crucial 
limitations, including the absence of financial data, non-standard
company tickers, and challenges with the presentation of time-series data.
At its core, this project centers on meticulous data refinement, yielding a comprehensive data set
encompassing all relevant variables.
